<p>If that quote sparks a warm glow in your insides, I can already tell we will probably work quite well together! I’ve been mucking around with the “thing that gets to the thing” for over 20 years.</p>
<p>What makes me different is that while I have always been an enthusiastic consumer of and (necessary in the earlier days) tinkerer with computers, the mechanics of them were never the most interesting parts to me.</p>
<p><strong>I have always believed technology’s biggest promise is what computers have allowed us to do. How they help us advance and change how we <em>get to the thing</em>. How they change the very nature of what <em>the thing</em> is.</strong></p>
<p>That is what I have always believed is amazing.</p>
